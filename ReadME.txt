I chose to use `std::unordered_map` in my assignment because it provides efficient lookup operations with constant-time complexity (`O(1)`), which is crucial for quickly retrieving city data. The hash-based lookup mechanism allows for fast key-value pair retrieval based on the hash value of the keys. Additionally, `std::unordered_map` does not impose any implicit sorting of elements, providing flexibility when the order of insertion or traversal is not a requirement. Lastly, `std::unordered_map` supports a wide range of key types and integrates seamlessly with other STL algorithms and containers, offering compatibility and interoperability within the Standard Library.
